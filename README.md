chirp
=====

An interface to convert strings to sounds (twitter -> chirp, chirp).

I figure if they are discernible patterns, they could make a good
accessibility tool. Many already use incredibly quick enunciations
as their default screen reader settings. Morse is another option.

But if it sounds like actual birds, you could have your mobile
chirp you updates, entirely doing away with looking at the screen
while potentially providing you with a private language.

Expected release date: September 2020.
